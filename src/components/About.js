                    <p> After working in the retail industry for the past few years, I decided to take the plunge into learning full stack web development through the flex track course provided by Coder Academy.</p>
                    <p>Although I'm studying full stack development, I am wanting to mainly focus on working in the front end as I enjoy it a lot!</p>
